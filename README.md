# ZyBooks Auto Clicker

This is a simple script I wrote to speed up tedious ZyBooks activities. There are many times when the content is already known, or just takes too long to do.

## What it Does

This script adds a floating menu to your ZyBooks page that lets you select which activities to complete and set a sleep time parameter. After clicking start, the selected activities are completed by the script.

## How to Use

1. Copy all the code from `zyclicker.js` and paste it into the developer console of your browser when navigated to a ZyBooks page.
1. Click the `ZyClicker Menu` floating button to open the menu, and check/uncheck the activities you want completed
1. Click start
1. Click the menu to collapse it (optional)
1. Increase the sleep parameter on future runs if you experience glitches or wrong answers
1. Click stop to stop the auto-clicking for animations (optional)
